----------------------------------------

----------
Wellcome to the JStuff, a project where the goal is provide an easy-to-use javascript front-end framework with all the common javascript needs to build your component or web-page. 

----------


**This framework is under construction, it's not usable yet!**
**When it's ready to use, this advice won't be here anymore.**

-----
**Philosophies of JStuff:**

>- Always is better a friendly and easy-to-use interface.
- It's not good interfere in the HTML document, JSTuff worrys about the semantic of the document.
- If the feature needs a CSS file to work, don't do it! JStuff is a javascript framework, is not a CSS framework.
- No one third library dependencies.
- The users always have the choice of include only a JStuff module instead all of JStuff code.
